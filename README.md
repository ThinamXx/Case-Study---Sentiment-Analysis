# **Case Study: Sentiment Analysis**
- In this repository, I have used Logistic Regression along with Count Vectorizer, Tf-idf and n-grams to perform Sentiment Analysis. I haved used Amazon mobile Dataset on mobile reviews.

**Logistic Regression**
- In statistics, the logistic model is used to model the probability of a certain class or event existing such as pass/fail, win/lose, alive/dead or healthy/sick. This can be extended to model several classes of events such as determining whether an image contains a cat, dog, lion, etc.

**Count Vectorizer**
- Scikit-learn's CountVectorizer is used to convert a collection of text documents to a vector of term/token counts. It also enables the â€‹pre-processing of text data prior to generating the vector representation. This functionality makes it a highly flexible feature representation module for text.

**Snapshot of the Result**

- Here, I have used __"1"__ to represent positive reviews and **"0"** to represent negative reviews.
